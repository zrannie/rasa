## Problem Statement
In the realm of presentations, speakers often face the challenge of managing their slides while maintaining engagement with their audience. Traditional presentation methods require physical interaction with the computer, disrupting the flow and visual continuity of the presentation. Rasa addresses these issues by offering a hands-free, voice-controlled presentation experience.

## Industry Trend and Market Competitor Analysis
The presentation software market is evolving, with a growing emphasis on interactivity and ease of use. Competitors in this space include established giants like Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides, which dominate due to their comprehensive feature sets and integration capabilities. However, these platforms lack advanced voice control features, positioning Rasa as a unique and innovative solution in this sector.

## Company Introduction
